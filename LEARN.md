> *"The best way to learn to code is by building real projects."*

This guide follows the **freeCodeCamp philosophy** of learning programming concepts by building practical, working applications. Through the Snake Game project, you'll master fundamental JavaScript concepts, modern ES6+ features, and game development principles.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this curriculum, you will have learned:

- **ES6 Modules** - Organize code into maintainable components
- **Game Loop Architecture** - Understanding frame-based rendering
- **Event Handling** - Keyboard input and user interactions
- **DOM Manipulation** - Dynamic content creation and styling
- **Local Storage** - Persistent data management
- **CSS Grid** - Modern layout techniques
- **Animation & Timing** - Smooth movements and interpolation
- **State Management** - Game state and data flow

## üìö Curriculum Structure

### Module 1: Project Setup & ES6 Modules
**Learn Modern JavaScript Module System by Building Game Architecture**

#### Concepts Covered:
- ‚úÖ ES6 Import/Export syntax
- ‚úÖ Module dependencies and organization
- ‚úÖ Separation of concerns

#### Code Analysis:
```javascript
// core.js - Main module importing dependencies
import { update as updateSnake, draw as drawSnake, getSnakeHead, isTailIntersect, score } from './snake.js'
import { update as updateHunt, draw as drawHunt } from './hunt.js'
import { outsideOfPlayground } from './playground.js'
import { SNAKE_SPEED } from './gameParameters.js'
```

**üí° Learning Challenge:**
Create your own module system. Try importing only specific functions you need using destructuring.

---

### Module 2: Game Loop & Animation
**Learn Animation Fundamentals by Building a 60 FPS Game Loop**

#### Concepts Covered:
- ‚úÖ RequestAnimationFrame API
- ‚úÖ Delta time calculations
- ‚úÖ Frame rate control
- ‚úÖ Interpolation for smooth movement

#### Code Deep Dive:
```javascript
function main(currentTime){
  // Frame rate control
  const deltaTime = currentTime - lastRenderTime;
  accumulatedTime += deltaTime;
  
  if (accumulatedTime > FRAME_TIME) {
    const steps = Math.floor(accumulatedTime / FRAME_TIME);
    accumulatedTime = accumulatedTime % FRAME_TIME;
    
    // Update game state
    for (let i = 0; i < steps; i++) {
      update();
    }
  }
  
  // Interpolation for smooth rendering
  const alpha = accumulatedTime / FRAME_TIME;
  draw(alpha);
}
```

**üèÜ Challenge Project:**

---

### Module 3: Object-Oriented Game Entities
**Learn Data Structures by Building Snake and Food Systems**

#### Concepts Covered:
- ‚úÖ Array manipulation and iteration

#### Snake Entity Analysis:
```javascript
let snakeBody = [
  { x: 26, y: 26 }  // Initial position
];

export function expandSnake(amount) {
  newSegments += amount;
  score += 10;  // Game logic coupling
}

export function onSnake(position, { ignoreHead = false } = {}) {
  return snakeBody.some((segment, index) => {
    if (ignoreHead && index === 0) return false;
    return equalPositions(segment, position);
  });
}
```

**üéÆ Interactive Exercise:**

#### Input System Breakdown:
```javascript
window.addEventListener('keydown', e => {
  switch(e.key){
    case 'ArrowUp':
      if (lastInputDirection.y !== 0) break;  // Prevent reverse
      inputDirection = { x: 0, y: -1};
      break;
    // ... other directions
  }
});
```

**üöÄ Enhancement Challenge:**
Add WASD controls, touch controls for mobile, or gamepad support.

#### Rendering System Analysis:
```javascript
export function draw(gameBoard, interpolationFactor = SMOOTHNESS_FACTOR) {
  snakeBody.forEach((segment, index) => {
    const snakeElement = document.createElement('div');
    snakeElement.classList.add('snake');
    
    // Dynamic positioning with CSS Grid
    snakeElement.style.gridColumnStart = segment.x;
    snakeElement.style.gridRowStart = segment.y;
    
    gameBoard.appendChild(snakeElement);
  });
}
```

**üé® Creative Challenge:**
Add particle effects, trail animations, or different snake skins.

---

### Module 6: Local Storage & Data Persistence
**Learn Browser Storage APIs by Building Score System**

#### Concepts Covered:
- ‚úÖ LocalStorage API
- ‚úÖ JSON serialization/deserialization
- ‚úÖ Data validation and error handling
- ‚úÖ User experience considerations

#### Score Management System:
```javascript
window.saveScore = function(score) {
  const scores = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('snakeScores')) || [];
  
  scores.push({
    score: score,
    date: new Date().toISOString()
  });
  
  localStorage.setItem('snakeScores', JSON.stringify(scores));
};
```

**üìä Data Challenge:**
Add player names, difficulty levels, or achievement systems.

  grid-template-rows: repeat(var(--grid-size), 1fr);
  width: 99vmin;
  height: 94vmin;
}

.snake {
  transition: transform 0.15s ease-out;
  will-change: transform; /* Performance optimization */
}
```

**üéØ Design Challenge:**
