# Classic Snake Game for the Web v0.0.12

### Installation
I suggest running the application through a simple web server. If you have Homebrew installed on your system, open your favorite Terminal and run the following command:

```sh
$ brew install nginx
```
Copy the source codes to NGINX's root folder, start NGINX and call the root folder with your favorite browser via the port you are running NGINX on.

Sample:
```sh
http://127.0.0.1:[PORT_NUMBER]/index.html
```
### Online Access
You can reach the game via the Snake for Web link on the http://balpinar.com/ homepage.

### How to play?
Press one of the Arrow keys to start the game.

### What if the game is over?
If you want to play again, press 'Ok' else press the 'Cancel' button.

### Development
Want to contribute? Great! If you would like to contribute, you can Fork the project and submit a Pull Request. Well, How to?

Before starting development, you need to open a `feature branch` with the Issue and Issue number you have chosen for yourself. For example `ISSUE-20`.

During your development, each commit should be a short imperative sentence and should be written as `[ISSUE-20]` at the end of the commit message.

An example commit message:
```
Add new style files for leaderboard [ISSUE-20]
```

When your development is complete, you can open a Pull Request from your `feature branch` to the `develop` branch.

`ISSUE-20` into `develop`

Pull Requests will be accepted that pass the code review session and comply with all the rules in the README file. Otherwise, a correction will be requested with a comment.

### New Features, Improvements and Bugs
All new features, improvements and bugs are listed under the [Issues](https://github.com/ibalpinar/snake-for-web/issues) section. You can start from this section to participate and contribute to the development of the game.

### Important Notice
I made this simple snake game for my 6-year-old daughter to both love software development and have fun. I'll continue to make minor improvements as I find the time. There may be some bugs. If you tell me, I'll fix it or you can contribute to fixing bugs that you find and improving the game.
