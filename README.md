# Classic Snake Game for the Web

### Installation
I suggest running the application through a simple web server. If you have Homebrew installed on your system, open your favorite Terminal and run the following command:

```sh
$ brew install nginx
```
Copy the source codes to NGINX's root folder, start NGINX and call the root folder with your favorite browser via the port you are running NGINX on.

Sample:
```sh
http://127.0.0.1:[PORT_NUMBER]/index.html
```

### Important Notice
I made this simple snake game for my 6-year-old daughter to both love software development and have fun. I'll continue to make minor improvements as I find the time. There may be some bugs. If you tell me, I'll fix it or you can contribute to fixing bugs that you find and improving the game.
